## Description

I hecking love solving 2d mazes :d

Was quite alright, but it feels a bit repetitive now as its like the 3rd time we have 2d-grid problem in this years AoC. 

But I shouldn't complain, they are still fun to solve.

Was late again with the solution due to having a job this week :(
Why does real life have to get in the way of my AoC fun?
