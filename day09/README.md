# Day 9

## Description

I think this is now officially a Rust AOC repo :-)

Todays challenge was quite easy on paper, but it took me some time to implement. There are a lot of things to keep in mind so I had to do some debugging to get it right.

Quite happy with the result however! Surely, there is a faster way to do part 2 particularly, but as long as the run time is `<1` second I'm happy.

### Time elapsed

- Loading File: 0.0000912s
