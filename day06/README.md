# Day 6

## Description

Back to rust today, it was similar to the day4 problem where I used rust (lots of coordinates stuff), so I decided to use rust again cause I could peek at my previous code.

Im happy with Part 1 solution, but Part 2 was a bit more challenging, so I ended up using a "brute force" solution, which is not the best, but it works. Only downside is that this is the first solution which takes more than 1 second to run ðŸ˜¨

On a side note, I think I was too ambitious with having a in-depth description in each daily README.md, so from now on I will keep it short and sweet. I just cannot be bothered to write a lot of text after solving the problem ðŸ˜…
